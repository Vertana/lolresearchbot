All features should be branches built off the dev branch.

You will need libunwind8, libgdiplus, and NET Core 2.0+ installed and in
your $PATH.

Once you have a branch created and checked out on your local machine, you'll
need to supply a _configuration.json file in the same folder as the executable.
It can then be run natively.

All merge requests should be on the dev branch.
